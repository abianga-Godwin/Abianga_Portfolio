# Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I happen to work for a **fictional company, Cyclistic**, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, I am following the steps of the data analysis process, which I term A.P.P.A.S.A. or APPASA.

## The average bike rental price in the U.S. market is approximately:

a. **$0.16** per minute for regular/**classic_bike**

b. **$0.28** per minute for e-bikes/**electric_bike**

## B. Types of User

a. Member - (Registered users using Cyclistic bikes)

b. Casual - (Non-registered users using Cyclistic bikes)

## The Objective:
1. Understand how Casual riders and annual Members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
2. Confirm if annual members are much more profitable than casual riders

## Organisation's Bais:
1. The **director** of marketing **believes** the company’s **future success depends on maximizing** the number of **annual memberships**.
2. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

# 1. Objective1: -- <img src="" width="800"/>
## Understand the behavioral differences between Casual and Member regarding bike usage.

# Ask - Questions to Answer 
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The chart below illustrates how both user groups utilize the two available bike types. Overall, it is evident that members use classic bikes more frequently than casual users.

In the chart below, we observe that members continue to utilize the second bike type, electric bikes, more frequently than casual users.
