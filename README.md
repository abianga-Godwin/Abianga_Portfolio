The Raw Data can be found from the Original source through this link: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
The Data source used here is the  202312 and 2024 (01-11) divvy-tripdata.zip files respectively.

Thanks to them that I have to opportunity to work with this data.

The Data on my Portfolio has already been cleaned up by me and few more columns have been added for further analysis.

# Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I happen to work for a **fictional company, Cyclistic**, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, I am following the steps of the data analysis process, which I term A.P.P.A.S.A. or APPASA.

## The average bike rental price in the U.S. market is approximately:

a. **$0.16** per minute for regular/**classic_bike**

b. **$0.28** per minute for e-bikes/**electric_bike**

## B. Types of User

a. Member - (Registered users using Cyclistic bikes)

b. Casual - (Non-registered users using Cyclistic bikes)

## The Objective:
1. Understand how Casual riders and annual Members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
2. Confirm if annual members are much more profitable than casual riders

## Organisation's Bais:
1. The **director** of marketing **believes** the company’s **future success depends on maximizing** the number of **annual memberships**.
2. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

# 1. Objective1: -- <img src="" width="800"/>
## Understand the behavioral differences between Casual and Member regarding bike usage.

# Ask - Questions to Answer 
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The chart below illustrates how both user groups utilize the two available bike types. Overall, it is evident that members use classic bikes more frequently than casual users.

In the chart below, we observe that members continue to utilize the second bike type, electric bikes, more frequently than casual users.

The two charts below highlights the behavior of Casual and Member users regarding their preferred bike type.

Based on the annual data, as shown in the chart below, it is evident that registered members use the bikes more frequently than non-registered members, as illustrated in the chart below.

However, one might be tempted to conclude that registered members, due to their higher trip frequency compared to casual users, are more likely to generate greater revenue. I contend that trip frequency alone does not outweigh the importance of trip duration, as demonstrated in the next chart.

While members exhibit higher trip frequency, casual users tend to use the bikes for longer durations. In my view, this longer usage more than offsets the higher frequency rate of registered members, which will ultimately be reflected in the annual revenue generated. 

Though the marginal intervals are 5 minutes it seems more than that in the graph. So I show the above chart from a different diagram and recalculated the durations into hours and represent that in a different diagram.

Here is a chart showing the trip duration of Casual and Member in hours.
